# Signer

This app signs text messages with Ethereum private key and verifies them.
The app allows a user to enter Ethereum private key, and to display the account balance on the Rinkeby network.
It also allows a user to sign any message with the userâ€™s private key and to check if a provided signature with the initial message is something that a user signed before.

The app is build with VIPER and clean architeture which modularises the app and makes code scalable and testable.
